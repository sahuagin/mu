//! `RetainedRope` — the retained pointer set substrate.
//!
//! Originally landed as a stub for mu-ktq's [`ProviderRenderer`] /
//! [`CacheStrategy`] trait surfaces. **mu-nat extends it in place**
//! with the four API methods named in
//! `specs/architecture/event-sourced-context.md` lines 538-562
//! ("Skills, tools, and the active context as a retained pointer
//! set"):
//!
//! - [`RetainedRope::activate_skill`] / [`deactivate_skill`] — skill
//!   activation IS pointer-set membership change.
//! - [`RetainedRope::register_tool_schema`] /
//!   [`unregister_tool_schema`] — a registered tool's schema IS an
//!   addressable span; the active tool set IS a retained pointer
//!   subset.
//! - [`RetainedRope::filter_tools`] — capability attenuation as a
//!   pointer-set filter over tool-schema spans. Returns a view
//!   (`Vec<&Span>`); the rope itself is the immutable substrate.
//! - [`RetainedRope::provenance`] — `span_id → originating
//!   `RopeEvent`. Returns `Option<&RopeEvent>` for None-on-not-found
//!   plus zero-copy access.
//!
//! The existing API (push / from_spans / iter / spans / len /
//! is_empty) is unchanged so the mu-ktq tests and any
//! [`ProviderRenderer`] / [`CacheStrategy`] consumer keeps working.
//!
//! Internal model:
//! - `spans` is the active retained set (callers iterate this for
//!   rendering).
//! - `events` is the append-only audit log
//!   ([`super::event::RopeEvent`]). Deactivation does NOT remove
//!   prior activation events.
//! - `origins` maps every span id ever introduced into the rope to
//!   the index of its originating event. Survives deactivation so
//!   `provenance(span_id)` answers historically.
//!
//! Full-rope features still out of scope (separate beads / spec
//! sections):
//! - file-watch handles, rehydration semantics (mu-56p)
//! - byte/token-range slicing (full source map; spec :167-228)
//! - eviction policy / retention-class evolution (spec :246-258)
//!
//! [`ProviderRenderer`]: super::ProviderRenderer
//! [`CacheStrategy`]: super::CacheStrategy
